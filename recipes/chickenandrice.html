    <p>Be aware your food will look <strong>nothing</strong> like this picture, the image is merely to show i can indeed add an image to my webpage.</p>
    <p>This recipe is for a simple and quite bland meal of, you guessed it, chicken and rice. however i will be adding in some vegetables and beans to spice things up. </p>
    <p>However simple and bland this meal is, it does contain an ample amount of protein and carbs.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul><li>Chicken breast</li>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Kidney beans</li>
    <li>Sweetcorn</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Start with beginning to cook your rice, if you dont know how to do that, its too late for you.</li>
    <li>Cut your chicken breasts in half and start to cook them in your preffered way, with your preffered seasoning.</li>
    <li>Whilst both your chicken, and rice, are cooking, add your sweetcorn and kidney beans to a sieve and rinse them. once rinsed, add to a large tupperware container. </li>
